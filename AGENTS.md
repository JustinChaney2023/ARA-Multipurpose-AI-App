# Project: My App

## Goal
Build: <one sentence>. Non-goals: <one sentence>.

## Repo map
- /docs: product + architecture + decisions
- /src: application code
- /scripts: developer commands

## Ground rules (must follow)
1) Make the smallest safe change that solves the task.
2) Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
3) Every behavior change must have a test (or a documented reason).
4) Never commit secrets. Use .env / .env.example.
5) If uncertain, write a TODO + question in the PR description.

## Commands (source of truth)
- Setup: `./scripts/setup.sh` (or document N/A)
- Verify (run before PR): `./scripts/verify.sh`
- Tests: `<your test command>`
- Lint/Format: `<your lint/format commands>`

## Coding conventions
- Naming: <brief>
- Error handling: <brief>
- Logging: <brief>
- API patterns: <brief>

## Definition of Done
- Tests pass
- Lint/format pass
- README updated if behavior or setup changed
- docs/decisions updated for major choices
